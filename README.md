# FindingWaldo
Finding Waldo from images without using deep learning of any sort.

### Project
Several computer vision methods such as Feature Matching, HOG + SVM, Haar Caascade have been used to find Waldo in the given set of data. Annotated Dataset is included and can be improved with better annotations if needed. 

Unique ideas such as filtering to find Waldo's shirt based on the stripes on his shirt have been tried as well. 
All the algorithms have been implemented using OpenCV2. More detailed information on the implementation can be found in the report attached.

### Future Plans:
Feel free to clone the repo and improve the code to find Waldo in the given dataset more accurately using any non Deep learning methods.
